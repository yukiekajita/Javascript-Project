# Javascript-UFO Sighting Project

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* I created a basic HTML web page with a starterCode/index.html file 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appended a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* I used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that showed events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
